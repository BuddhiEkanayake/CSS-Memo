# CSS-Memo
I'm focusing on memorizing and strengthening my CSS knowledge. To do this, I'm following a Udemy course and practicing on GitHub. I also plan to create a README file for my GitHub repository to document my progress and key CSS concepts. This will help me organize and review what Iâ€™ve learned.

# Why CSS Mastery?
This section explains the purpose of my journey: to memorize and master CSS concepts and techniques, from basics to advanced. By following a structured course and documenting each step, I aim to build a solid CSS foundation that I can refer back to.

# Course Outline
A brief outline of the course sections:

1. Introduction to CSS
2. Selectors and Styling
3. Layouts (Flexbox, Grid)
4. Responsive Design
5. Advanced Techniques
6. Animations and Transitions
I'll update this section as I progress through each module.
