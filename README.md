# CSS-Memo
I'm focusing on memorizing and strengthening my CSS knowledge. To do this, I'm following a Udemy course and practicing on GitHub. I also plan to create a README file for my GitHub repository to document my progress and key CSS concepts. This will help me organize and review what Iâ€™ve learned.
